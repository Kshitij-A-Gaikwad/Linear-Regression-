Hi everyone !!!
Here is my latest project on simple linear regression machine learning model where I have used my knowledge and skills to showcase how a housing sales model works for predicting
sales price with respect to its various attributes such as number of floors , flat area , basement area , etc . I have also tried to visualize my code as much as possible, to make 
everyone understand the machune learning problem. I have used Data Exploration and Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Cost Function, Errors, Residuals , Gradient Descent to understand the 
regression model thoroughly. 

NOTE: "1. Regression - Module - (Housing Prices).csv" excel file is raw file without data preprocessing and after preprocessing I have saved the file with the name 'Transformed_Housing_Data2.csv'
